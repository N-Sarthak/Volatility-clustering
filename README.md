# Volatility Clustering Mini Project

## Definition
Volatility clustering refers to the tendency of large (small) changes in asset prices
to be followed by large (small) changes. This means volatility appears in clusters
rather than being constant over time.

## Example
During the COVID-19 crash in 2020, the S&P 500 experienced large swings for several days.
Those high-volatility periods were followed by calm periods, showing volatility clustering.

## Objective
This notebook explores volatility clustering using:
- S&P 500 daily, hourly, and weekly data
- Log returns and absolute returns
- Autocorrelation and rolling volatility envelopes

## Libraries Used
- yfinance
- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
